Project description: 
My vision: “The club can’t even handle me right now” soundscape of my mind and external state during a run. 
What I wanted to get across were the sounds that I focus on during a run and how this changes throughout- I focus on 
my breathing mostly, but I wanted to showcase how I am affected by the music I listen to and how a song like B2b, one 
with a strong bassline, can influence me. I also wanted to draw connections between the beat of a song and the beat of 
my heart, breathing, and steps on pavement- all sort of keeping time with each other and moving in tandem.
