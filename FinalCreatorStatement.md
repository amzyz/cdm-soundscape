Creator’s Statement

This project chronicles a runner’s mental state and tells a story about going on a morning run. I wanted to tell a story using sounds one would typically hear on a street, which is the setting of the story. Additionally, I wanted to use sounds that represent the runner’s internal state. I thought about what one might focus on during a run, like their heartbeat, their steps pounding on gravel and concrete, and their breathing. I also wanted to incorporate samples of music as a way to enhance how it sounds and further help the listener relate to the runner in the story.

I aimed to put the listener inside the mind of a runner that uses a run as a way to cope and handle their emotions. I thought about themes of distraction, catharsis, connecting with the outside world, and connecting with oneself. I also aimed to use motifs like heartbeats and a sample of a Lorde song that I hold near and dear to me in order to convey pangs of emotion that the runner experiences alongside feelings of physical activation and serotonin from exercise. I added samples of my favorite running songs, along with real clips of my breathing during running in order to further place the listener in my mind.

The soundscape begins with the sounds of a morning as the runner wakes up to the sounds of birds. The beginning “morning sequence” represents an awakening, a start of consciousness that we all go through everyday. Then, the soundscape starts chronologically detailing the steps one would take as they leave the house, prepare their music for the run, and start running on the streets. I sourced sounds of the street for the project at the end of my runs in order to make it realistic. The sounds at the end of the project are sounds from buses and cars at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and Bellefield. Finally, the project concludes with the runner going back home and experiencing that “pang” signified by the Lorde song sample and unplugging their headphones, showing that the run and distraction is over.

For the audio effects, I used fade-in and fade-out, compression, amplification, split-cut, pasting/copying a clip, moving a clip, reverb, and echo.


Reflection and Screenshots of the Process
Caption: Early on in the process, I played around with many volume control tools on Audacity, particularly compression and amplification on multiple clips of sounds that overpowered the piece or were off-balance with other clips in terms of volume. In this screenshot, I was adjusting the volume of the headphone-plugging-in sound effect via compression because it was very jarring to the listener.

Caption: Here, I was amplifying the chirping of the birds in order to convey a sense of the outside world flooding the character with clarity once they step outside. I wanted this part to be louder because it showed a shift of consciousness to nature, what is occurring to this person’s senses, and the fact that they are focusing on these sounds. This is based on my emotions on a morning run, where I am still a bit sleepy, still in my head, so I wanted this to convey the idea of grounding myself a bit more in reality and focusing on the natural world around me to do so.

Caption: Here, I dove a bit deeper into the Compression effect to adjust the heartbeat “backtrack”, a constant beat that plays the whole project. I ended up amplifying some portions of the heartbeat in specific sections to convey that the runner is more conscious of their heartbeat at certain times, appealing to that experience of hearing your heartbeat in your head when you do heavy physical activity or are primed to do so. I adjusted the Threshold to settings other than the default so they would mesh well with the other sound clips that were playing at the same time. To do this and make sure it sounded right, I approached this with a “guess-and-check” method and adjusted the levels, played it back, then adjusted as needed. I compressed many other parts of the project, especially the clips that I overlaid on the footsteps running sounds and the main “song of the run”. I compressed my breathing audio clips to get the volume at a good level along with the heartbeat sound at parts where the song was meant to “drown out” the heartbeat.


In terms of creative vision, I think the compression tool leant itself to conveying the themes of distraction. I was able to compress sound effects while other sounds got louder, ultimately manifesting this idea that the runner listens to loud music and runs in attempt to drown things out.

Caption: This time, I was experiencing some issues with reverb because I was trying it out for the first time. I wanted to experiment with the default room size % because I knew I was going to use it to make the music clips during the actual “running part” of the soundscape, especially “B2b”, have reverb to demonstrate how loud and all-sense-numbing the music is. I tested the percentages and would often make it larger than the preset to get the effect I wanted, which was the way the music sounds when I have it full-blast on noise-cancelling headphones. 

There were also moments where I let the heartbeats and street sounds “drown out” and overpower the music, and I stopped the music by fading it out. I wanted the reverb to amplify the difference between when the music is blasting versus when the runner focuses back on their own heartbeat and the sounds around them.

Caption: Using the limiter effect proved to be very ineffective to what I wanted in the project. I included this screenshot to convey that throughout my learning process in Audacity, I decided that some tools did not end up being necessary to be used to get across what I wanted. I had trouble with getting the headphones effect to be quieter, so I tested the limiter. I knew I wanted to tame the really high “peaks” of sound that I saw in the waves, so I played around with it, but it ended up feeling too muffled and very unlike the sound I hear when I plug my headphones in. So, I chose to keep the higher peaks and made the creative decision to jar the listener a bit with this sound– it is always jarring when plug my headphones in, so I feel this technical difficulty made me think a bit more about what I wanted the reader to hear and feel. I think this choice made it so that the reader is more in the shoes of the runner and can experience the sounds they are, perhaps leading to them gaining more empathy and relating to the runner if they can hear sounds as though they are also about to go running with them.

Caption: This is not exactly a moment where I faced a technical challenge, but I wanted to document when I added more song clips that ultimately enriched my project. I feel like this is really when my vision came as close as it could because of the added textures and emotions the new clips brought to the project. I used “212” by Azealia Banks because it is another one of my favorite running songs and represents upbeat and happy emotions– one I typically feel when I get myself hype to run. This was intentionally added after the headphone-plug-effect was added because it shows that this was a change in mindset– to the listener, it means it’s go-time, it’s time to run. Similarly, I added more clips of “B2b” by Charli xcx, another one of my running songs, which comes a bit later and is mostly incorporated with typical “running sounds” like my breathing, the sound of footsteps on pavement and gravel, and the sounds of the crosswalk; and used a specific part of the song “I don’t wanna feel feelings” to show the idea that this runner is attempting to escape something internal and thereby releasing emotions by doing this physical activity.

I also specifically selected the most ambient parts of the song “Ribs” by Lorde in the track as a motif that the listener may recognize from the beginning. I wanted to convey a sense that this emotion, as represented by the clip of the song, would come through despite the loud music and physical activity and distraction of the outside. It conveyed the runner’s internal feelings being made known in their consciousness regardless of a run. I put the first clip right as the birds were chirping and this person was waking up, showing this “activation” of melancholy immediately as they woke. But as soon as the headphones were plugged in, club and upbeat music plays and the person is activated in a different way, doing a physical activity and focusing on sounds around them. After the run is complete and the person gets a dose of upbeat, happy feelings, signified by “B2b” and “212” in the middle and end, I made sure to add a clip of “Ribs” as the headphone-plugging-effect occurred once more, signifying that the deeper emotions will arise regardless of the upbeat and uplifting nature of the run. This also comes right before the runner goes home and the door shutting sound effect indicates the conclusion of the soundscape. This was meant to show this juxtaposition between emotions– some of catharsis, both real and manufactured by activity and loud music– versus the feelings that leak through before and after the run is over. 

Another reason I added more song samples is because a peer reviewer asked why I centered the soundscape around one song, which made me realize my soundscape was too reliant on my one sound sample, B2b. It was ultimately good to hear that my project may have centered upon a song too heavily and made me reconsider my design choices. 


Caption: This shows the design choice of adding in crosswalk sound effects came about towards the end as a finishing touch. I wanted to add more sounds that the runner would hear while running on the streets of Oakland, and I thought that the crosswalk noises were very relevant to what I hear and need to pay attention to while running. I wanted to convey that these sounds bring a runner “back to reality” if they are listening to really loud music, focusing on their breathing, and exerting physical energy. While adding this, I was thinking about how I would conclude the soundscape. I took inspiration from real-life Oakland street noises that I typically hear after a run. I used a recording of sounds from the Carnegie Mellon Institute, where I typically rest after a night run. This soundscape is one run condensed into 3 minutes, but one could think of it like a day condensed as well. I wake up to the birds chirping, but conclude the project with the sounds of the city at night.
