I have added three new tracks to the project, and I've changed my narrative to one where I go on a run. I was thinking I would add some samples of songs I listen to, sort of like a club 
on the concrete vibe to this. I added my favorite running song, which I still need to cut around and put in various parts of the narrative. I recorded some outdoor sounds I typically hear when 
I run late at night, like the buses making their noises and the street sounds of the cars. That along with some other diegetic noises like my headphone jack being plugged in will serve as the beginning
of the narrative.
